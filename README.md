🌸 Iris Flower Classification using Supervised Learning (KNN)
📘 Overview
This project demonstrates how to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using a supervised machine learning algorithm, specifically K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

It is a beginner-friendly project that teaches the basics of data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using Python and scikit-learn.

🎯 Objective
To develop a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower using the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

🧠 What is Supervised Learning?
Supervised learning is a machine learning technique where the model is trained on a labeled dataset — that means each input (flower measurements) is matched with the correct output (species). The model learns the mapping from input to output and can then predict for new data.

📊 Dataset
We used the famous Iris Dataset, which contains:

150 samples

4 numerical features

3 output classes (species)

The dataset is available directly via scikit-learn.

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

scikit-learn – for ML algorithms

Pandas & NumPy – for data handling

Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization

🤖 Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
KNN is a simple and effective algorithm:

It stores all available data.

When a new input is given, it finds the "k" nearest training examples.

It predicts the class based on majority voting.

🪜 Workflow
Import libraries

Load the dataset

Preprocess the data

Split into training and test sets

Train KNN model

Predict test results

Evaluate using accuracy, confusion matrix

Visualize results

✅ Sample Code
python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, confusion_matrix

# Load data
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train model
model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:\n", confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))
📈 Results
Accuracy: 100% (in our test run)

Confusion Matrix: No misclassifications
